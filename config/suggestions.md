# Configuration Element: Approved Suggestions Feed

### What is it for?
This element allows you to define a channel where suggestions will be sent once they've been approved, or directly after submission if the mode is set to `autoapprove`.

### Usage
Set up the suggestion feed using `.config suggestions [channel]`

### Aliases
`suggestionchannel` and `suggestionschannel`

### Accepted Imputs
Any channel name, ID or #mention

?> It is recommended to set up a channel that is only used for server suggestions, as it can quickly get messy if the channel is used for multiple purposes at once!
