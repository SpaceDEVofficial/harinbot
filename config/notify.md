# Configuration Element: Notifications

### What is it for?
This setting defines if users will receive a DM when an action is taken on one of their suggestions. This is a **server-wide** setting, users can still define their own settings with the [notify](/sumup.md#special-sunflowers) command.

### Usage
Set up server notifications using `.config notify on/off/toggle`

### Aliases
`notif`, `notification` and `notifications`

### Accepted Imputs
Either `on`, `off` or `toggle`

?> DM Notifications will not be sent if the user blocked the bot or chose not to accept DMs from server members.
