# Official Suggester Documentation {docsify-ignore-all}
---

All sections in these docs will use the bot's default prefix, which is currently `.` (yes, that's a dot). You can change it at anytime using the [config](/config/configuration.md) command, and more precisely by redefining the [Prefix](/config/prefix.md) element.

In this documentation, arguments surrounded by [square brackets] are __required__ while arguments surrounded by (parenthesis) are __optional__.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask us in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/G5pEdUp)! Don't worry, we don't bite :)
